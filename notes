Cloned remote directory on GitHub to Documents folder (crptwriter and GitHub-pages-with-jekyll). Run from the Documents folder
git clone https://github.com/bankyo/crptwriter.git and https://github.com/bankyo/github-pages-with-jekyll.git
Can get some great hands-on practice working on these remote directories.
Note that these directories were already cloned into the GitHub folder using the GitHub desktop
ran commands git fetch origin, git push --all successfully to push changes to the remote directory
