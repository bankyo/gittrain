Git --help clone - get help on clone command syntax

git clone (https://github.com/bankyo/crptwriter.git) - Clone a repository into a new directory
$ git clone git://github.com/schacon/grit.git
git clone /home/alice/project myrepo - This creates a new directory "myrepo" containing a clone of Alice's repository
alice$ cd /home/alice/project
alice$ git pull /home/bob/myrepo master - merges the changes from Bob's "master" branch into Alice's current branch

Alice can peek at what Bob did without merging first, using the "fetch" command
alice$ git fetch /home/bob/myrepo master
alice$ git log -p HEAD..FETCH_HEAD
If Alice wants to visualize what Bob did since their histories forked she can issue the
following command:
$ gitk HEAD..FETCH_HEAD
Alice may want to view what both of them did since they forked. She can use three-dot form
instead of the two-dot form:
$ gitk HEAD...FETCH_HEAD
