Part 1

Escape key Y - see list of commands
Ditto - copy files

cd ~/Downloads/   - To download the file:  - curl -O [the URL of the file]
caffeinate -u -t [number of seconds] - Keep your Mac awake
sudo systemsetup -setrestartfreeze on - Make your Mac automatically restart after a crash
Emacs Fn, F10, t, g
ls -R - expands sub-folders
cat [file path] - View any file's contents
defaults write com.apple.screencapture location [place where you want screen grabs saved]. Then hit Enter and then: killall SystemUIServer And hit Enter again.
defaults write NSGlobalDomain NSDocumentSaveNewDocumentsToCloud -bool false/true Stop apps from saving to iCloud by default
sudo chmod 777 path-to-file - How to alter file permissions using Terminal. To modify the permissions to allow access and reading, but prohibit changing the file, swap 777 for 644
sudo chown your-short-user-name path-to-file - To change ownership of a file to your account
defaults write com.apple.screencapture type JPG - to change the default to jpeg from .png
defaults write com.apple.finder QLEnableTextSelection -bool TRUE; killall Finder - Enable text selection in Quick Look
Say "Banky is a genius"





For a beginners some of the basic computational task is to:


View the contents of a directory : A directory may contains visible and invisible files with different file permissions. - ls -a -l -t
Viewing blocks, HDD partition, External HDD
Checking the integrity of Downloaded/Transferred Packages
Converting and copying a file
Know your machine name, OS and Kernel
Viewing history - history
Being root
Make Directory = mkdir md
Make Files - touch
Changing the file permission - chmod
Own a file - chown
Install, Update and maintain Packages
Uncompressing a file - tar
See current date, time and calendar - cal - date
Print contents of a file - cat
Copy and Move - cp - mv
See the working directory for easy navigation - pwd
Change the working directory - cd

Part 2

What after these initial commands? Obviously we moved to the next part of this article where we provided commands for computational tasks like:

Finding a file in a given directory - find
Searching a file with the given keywords - grep
Finding online documentation - man man
See the current running processes - ps
Kill a running process - kill
See the location of installed Binaries - whereis
Starting, Ending, Restarting a service - service
Making and removing of aliases - alias - unalias
View the disk and space usages - df - du
Removing a file and/or directory - rm -rf
Print/echo a custom output on standard output - echo
Changing password of one-self and other’s, if you are root. - passwd
View Printing queue - lpr
Compare two files - cmp
Download a file, the Linux way (wget)
Mount a block / partition / external HDD - mount
Compile and Run a code written in ‘C’, ‘C++’ and ‘Java’ Programming Language


Part 3

In our Third and last article of this series, we tried to cover the commands that would be required for the computational task like:

Configuring Network Interface - ifconfig - Assign IP Address to an Interface eth0 -ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.12
Viewing custom Network Related information - netstat -at -s
Getting information about Internet Server with customisable switches and Results - nslookup
Digging DNS - dig
Knowing Your System uptime - uptime
Sending an occasional Information to all other logged-in users - wall
Send text messages directly to a user -mesg - write - talk
Combination of commands -
Renaming a file -rename
Seeing the processes of a CPU - top
Creating newly formatted ext4 partition
Text File editors like vi, emacs and nano - vi a.text - nano a,text
Copying a large file/folder with progress bar - rsync -P - alias cp='rsync -aP'
Keeping track of free and available memory - free -b -k -m -g -h -s 3
Backup a mysql database - msqldump
Make difficult to guess – random password - mkpasswd
Merge two text files - paste
List of all the opened files - lsof
