1. git init - start a new project
1a. git clone <remote-url> - work on an existing project
2. Modify, rename and delete files or add new ones
3. git status - what happened since the last commit
4. git add <filename>, 
   git remote add origin git@github.com:bankyo/python.git
   git remote add git https://github.com/bankyo/git.git
   git remote add xyz https://github.com/us/repo -git remote add <shortname> <url>
5. git commit -m "message"
6. git status - to verify changes added to staging area were committed
7. git log - inspect the commit history

git config --get remote.origin.url - returns url path e.g. https://github.com/bankyo/gittrain.git

Branching and Merging
1. git branch <new-branch-name> - start a new feature
   git branch -u origin/scrollfix	-to set current branch to track remote branch scrollfix
2. git checkout <new-branch-name> - switch contexts
3. git merge <branch-to-integrate> - first switch to the branch that is supposed to receive these changes. Then call the git merge command with the name of the branch you want to merge
   git merge origin

Sharing work via the remote repositories
1. git checkout --track <remote/branch> - track a remote branch
1a. git push -u <remote> <local branch> - publish a local branch on a remote server
2. git fetch <remote> - stay up-to-date about remote changes
   git fetch origin - to fetch from your remote repository origin
   git fetch --all - to fetch from all your remotes
   
3. git pull - integrate new changes from the remote repositories
   git pull origin - is a command that combines git fetch and git merge
   
4. git push - to upload the local changes you made in your current HEAD branch
   git push -u <remote> <local branch> - publish a local branch on a remote server
   git push -u origin master - to share your master branch with your origin repository
   git push --all - specify bankyo wEm-9TV-FYu-oX6  https://github.com/bankyo/gittrain.git
   git push --set-upstream origin feature - will create a new remote branch called feature

Git --help clone - get help on clone command syntax

git clone https://github.com/bankyo/crptwriter.git - Clone a repository into a new directory
git clone git://github.com/schacon/grit.git
git clone /home/alice/project myrepo - This creates a new directory "myrepo" containing a clone of Alice's repository
alice$ cd /home/alice/project
alice$ git pull /home/bob/myrepo master - merges the changes from Bob's "master" branch into Alice's current branch

alice$ git fetch /home/bob/myrepo master -Alice can peek at what Bob did without merging first, using the "fetch" command
alice$ git log -p HEAD..FETCH_HEAD
$ gitk HEAD..FETCH_HEAD	- If Alice wants to visualize what Bob did since their histories forked
$ gitk HEAD...FETCH_HEAD - Alice may want to view what both of them did since they forked. She can use three-dot form instead of the two-dot form:

git remote -v 			- from within (a cloned directory)

git remote rename ol nu 	- to rename a remote repository
git remote rm nu 		- to remove a remote repository
