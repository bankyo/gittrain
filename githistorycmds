VIEWING PROJECT HISTORY
#At any point you can view the history of your changes using
$ git log

#If you also want to see complete diffs at each step, use
$ git log -p

#Often the overview of the change is useful to get a feel of each step
$ git log --stat --summary

#to see the details about this commit
$ git show c82a22c39cbc32576f64f5c6b3f24b99ea8149c7

$ git show c82a22c39c   # the first few characters of the name are usually enough
$ git show HEAD         # the tip of the current branch
$ git show experimental # the tip of the "experimental" branch

#Every commit usually has one "parent" commit which points to the previous state of the project:

$ git show HEAD^  # to see the parent of HEAD 
$ git show HEAD^^ # to see the grandparent of HEAD
$ git show HEAD~4 # to see the great-great grandparent of HEAD

#Note that merge commits may have more than one parent:

$ git show HEAD^1 # show the first parent of HEAD (same as HEAD^)
$ git show HEAD^2 # show the second parent of HEAD

#You can also give commits names of your own; after running

$ git tag v2.5 1b2e1d63ff #you can refer to 1b2e1d63ff by the name "v2.5"

#Any Git command that needs to know a commit can take any of these names. For example 

$ git diff v2.5 HEAD     # compare the current HEAD to v2.5
$ git branch stable v2.5 # start a new branch named "stable" based at v2.5
$ git reset --hard HEAD^ # reset your current branch and working directory to its state at HEAD^

#The git grep command can search for strings in any version of your project, so

$ git grep "hello" v2.5 #searches for all occurrences of "hello" in v2.5.

# Many Git commands also take sets of commits, which can be specified in a number of ways
$ git log v2.5..v2.6            # commits between v2.5 and v2.6
$ git log v2.5..                # commits since v2.5
$ git log --since="2 weeks ago" # commits from the last 2 weeks
$ git log v2.5.. Makefile       # commits since v2.5 which modify Makefile

$ git log stable..master #will list commits made in the master branch but not in the stable branch,
#while
$ git log master..stable #will show the list of commits made on the stable branch but not the master branch.

$ gitk --since="2 weeks ago" drivers/ #allows you to browse any commits from the last 2 weeks of commits that modified files under the "drivers" directory
